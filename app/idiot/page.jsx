          I'm Sorry for the Disturbance, I don't know why but I felt like
          proposing you today. Currently it's 12:37 AM Mid-Night I'm trying to
          build a new website but don't know why it's not working. So I created
          a extra path in my old website🤦‍♂️. Once I think about something I just
          don't care I'll just get it done. I hate giving up and I don't want to
          regret later about thinking that I should have done that.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's been more than one year I proposed you for the first time. It was
          nice experience though. I think I have proposed you more than 5 times
          but got rejected everytime😂😂 it's ok I don't mind failing. Atleast
          it's still way more better than not trying. Don't know what's your
          mood and life status now but still doing all these things like an
          Idiot.🙊
        </p>
        <p>
          Some says if you don't go after what you want, you'll never get it.
          But some says if it really your's it'll definitely come back. Don't
          know whom to believe, but I really enjoy experiencing the life rather
          than escaping from it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I think I'm an Idiotic Idiot, 2 day's back when I said "Just get marry
          idiot" to you, you replied "You won't ahh", I don't know am I
          tubelight or what, but still I didn't understood what you said🤦‍♂️😂😂
        </p>
        <p>
          I really don't know what to type😂😂, never felt learning programming
          and computer difficult but understanding a women is way more
          complicated than nuclear bomb💣 and it really need guts to propose a
          girl even after being rejected.
        </p>
        <p>
          You are the one running in my mind 24 x 7. I still can't forget the
          days, I sat next to you and the day I heard your voice on call for 5s
          on September 15th last year. There are only two things I learnt from
          love
        </p>
        <div>
          <p>1. You may gonna lose yourself, while trying to win someone.</p>
          <p>2. You'll never get to know the way she wanted to be loved.</p>
        </div>
        <p>
          Please ignore chat with us popup on bottom right corner it's my
          project
        </p>
        <p>
          Tomorrow I'll get ready to receive scoldings and rejections from you,
          sounds amazing maa😂😂 But atleast give me a remarks/feedback for this
          please I'm gonna correct it
        </p>
